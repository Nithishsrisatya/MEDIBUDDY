# Appointment Booking Flow Implementation

## Frontend Changes
- [x] Clean up AppointmentBooking.js by removing unused functions (fetchAvailability, generateAvailableSlots) and imports (useCallback, addDays, List, ListItem, etc.)
- [x] Simplify handleNext function by removing fetchAvailability call since DoctorCalendar handles availability internally
- [x] Remove redundant blank lines and clean up code structure

## Backend Changes
- [ ] Ensure availability endpoint returns up-to-date data
- [ ] Verify double-booking prevention is working

## Testing
- [ ] Test calendar view displays available dates correctly
- [ ] Test time selection for selected date
- [ ] Test refresh functionality
- [ ] Test real-time updates
- [ ] Test booking prevents double-booking
- [ ] Verify 3-step flow works end-to-end
